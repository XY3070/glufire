- **Modular Design**: The codebase is structured into three core physical models and an integrated model, promoting clarity, understanding, and extensibility.
    - `models/and_gate.py`: Environmental response AND gate logic.
    - `models/glu_metabolism.py`: Glutamate production and secretion model.
    - `models/diffusion_pk.py`: Multi-compartment pharmacokinetic and tumor diffusion model.
    - `models/integrated_model.py`: Integrated therapeutic model combining the above modules.
    - `models/pk_toxicity.py`: Neurotoxicity assessment module based on a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model.
- **Therapeutic Efficacy**:
    - **Control Group**: Low T7 activity (637 AU) leads to minimal glutamate (0.001 mM), resulting in no ferroptosis and normal tumor growth.
    - **Therapy Group**: High T7 activity (1217 AU) drives significant glutamate production (0.362 mM), leading to a ferroptosis rate of 2.5 /hr and substantial tumor reduction.
- **Numerical Stability**: Incorporates mechanisms to prevent negative values and extreme fluctuations, ensuring biological plausibility.
- **Clear Analysis Workflow**: Main scripts generate key analytical plots, providing intuitive visualization of system behavior.
- **Parameterization**: Model parameters are loaded from the `params/` directory and can be flexibly configured via command-line arguments or external JSON files.

## üìä Key Validation Results

- **Simulated Therapeutic Efficacy**: The model demonstrates a significant difference in tumor response between the control and therapy groups.
    - **Control Group Simulation**: Under conditions simulating a control scenario (low T7 activity), the model predicts minimal glutamate production, leading to no induced ferroptosis and sustained tumor growth.
    - **Therapy Group Simulation**: In the simulated therapy scenario (high T7 activity), the model predicts substantial glutamate production, resulting in a notable ferroptosis rate and a significant reduction in tumor volume.
- **Neurotoxicity Assessment**: The pharmacokinetic model for neurotoxicity indicates that while therapeutic glutamate levels are achieved in the tumor, systemic glutamate concentrations remain within acceptable limits, suggesting a favorable safety profile in the simulated environment.
- **AND Gate Response**: The AND gate model accurately reflects the differential T7 activity under varying oxygen and temperature conditions, aligning with expected biological responses.
